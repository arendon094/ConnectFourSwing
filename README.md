# ConnectFourSwing

### Premise for project

This was a project I worked on during my third year at CSULA. At the time I was
a tutor for a UCLA after school program at Franklin High School in 
Highland Park. The objective was to come up with a project that would get students
interested in computer science. I ultimately decided to create a Connect 
Four game.

### Approach

The end goal was to create a connect four game using Java Swing. My first
approach was to create a console version of the game in order focus only 
on game logic and not get caught up worrying about the Swing libraries. 
The majority of the gmae logic is done through the use of conditional 
statements to check for winning conditions. 
Once the console version was completed I moved on to develop the GUI
version. 

### Challenges

The biggest challenge here was definitely making this project look 
presentable. Through the use of Java Swing this was accomplished after 
spending hours referring to the documentation. Another challenge worth 
mentioning would be making sure winning conditions (vertical, horizontal,
 diagonal) produced the correct result for a player when playing.
